# Chimera
Chimera is a mod for Halo: Combat Evolved for the PC.

## Installation
Here is the installation procedure for installing Chimera:

    1. Update your installation of Halo to version 1.10.
    2. Back up your game's Strings.dll. Renaming it to `strings-old.dll` works.
    3. Copy strings.dll, chimera.dll, and chimera.ini into your game folder.
    
    NOTE: Each file goes into the main game folder, NOT controls. If you put
    the files in controls, it will not work.

Uninstalling Chimera is simple:

    1. Delete Chimera's strings.dll, chimera.dll, and (optionally) chimera.ini.
    2. Rename your backed up copy of Halo's Strings.dll back to `strings.dll`.

## Mod support
Chimera does not support any binary mods like HAC2 or Open Sauce. The reason
for this is because they modify the game in similar ways, resulting in them
conflicting with one another. Supporting just one of these mods would mean
extra development time that I don't have. Sorry.
